# CSV Mapper
An online platform that provides real-time graphs driven by CSV data.

## Rationale
This project was created to allow Gamma Telecom to view performance critical
business systems.

## Dependencies
This application was built to run inside a Docker container on a Linux host. The
following dependencies are required:
- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

## Quick-Start Guide
This application was built to run inside a Docker container. This guide is
written for Arch based Linux distributions. Make sure each of the required
dependencies listed above have been installed on the host machine.

1. Clone the git repository to a Linux host.
2. Start the `docker.service` service. On Systemd based distributions this can
   be done by running `systemctl start docker.service` with super-user access.
3. If you do not have the `/.secrets/` directory (which is not included on
   GitHub since it contains passwords), you need to clear the contents of the
   `/data/mysql/` directory. Next, run `chmod +x setup.sh`, then execute
   `./setup.sh`. This script will create any missing directories and generate a
   root MySQL user and password, as well as a django MySQL user and password.
   After `./setup.sh` has finished, you need to create a new `graph` MySQL table
   and give the `django` MySQL user full access to it. You need to expose the
   port for the MySQL database via the `docker-compose.yaml` file to interact
   with the database. Alternatively, `phpMyAdmin` could be added to the
   `docker-compose.yaml` file with an exposed port to modify the MySQL databases
   via a web interface.
4. The container and MySQL database should now be setup. The application can be
   started by running `docker-compose up -d` as a super-user.

## Project Structure
- `/.secrets/`: Contains sensitive information such as the plain-text `root` and
  `django` MySQL user passwords. This directory is not included in the
  repository. It can be generated by running `/setup.sh`. Please refer to the
  quick-start guide above.
- `/data/mysql/`: Contains the MySQL database.
- `/data/django/`: Contains a file-system that the Django application container
  can access. This is where CSV files can be installed that the container can
  access. To access CSV files in this location, use `file:///data/` as the
  source directory, appending the path after `/data/django/` to the end. For
  example: `file:///data/example/csv/simple_data.csv`.
- `/docker/django/`: Contains a `dockerfile` used to build the Django Docker
  container, an entry-point shell script, and a list of Python requirements to
  be installed via the `pip` command when building the container.
- `/docs/`: Contains documentation about the project. This contains planning
  documents written in markdown that can be viewed directly on GitHub.
- `/log/django/`: Contains log files for the Django application.
- `/src/`: Contains the Django project source code. The Django container has
  read-write access to this directory.
- `/docker-compose.yaml`: Docker compose file used to configure and run the
  application within a Docker environment.
- `/setup.sh`: A shell script for quickly setting up the Docker environment.
  Additional manual setup is required after running this script. Please refer to
  the quick-start guide above.
